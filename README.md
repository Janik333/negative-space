# negative-space
Prototype for an original puzzle game.
I never decided on a name for it, I've referred to it as 'Negative Space', 'Flip', and the very creative 'Black and White World Game'

A University project I created in 2015.
Made in GameMaker

The actual main objective was to produce a report of the development of this game, that report can be found on the root (Black and White World Game.pdf)

Commentary playthrough (recorded in 2019):

I also seemed to have left some debug buttons in in jump to different levels,number keys, numpad keys, function keys.
Backspace restarts a level (Although the levels were designed in a way so you don't have to restart them)
